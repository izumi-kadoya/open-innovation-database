 Invitae says the acquisition will help it scale up its ability to provide personal guidance alongside its DNA test results.

The deal comes after Invitae inked a contract with insurance giant Cigna to bring its tests in-network, starting December 1st. This will give Invitae access to about 295 million people in the U.S. who are covered by Cigna.

Clear Genetics' chatbot platform, named Gia, is designed to shepherd users through the consent and risk assessment phases, as well as help determine the applicable insurance benefits. Additionally, it can provide clinicians with a portal to help manage patient care.

Invitae CEO Sean George said that the acquisition of Clear Genetics is ""a critical step in our mission to make genetic testing more accessible and affordable for everyone."" He added that the company's ""combined capabilities will make it easier for patients to get the genetic information they need to make informed healthcare decisions.""

Allegheny Health Network (AHN) and Cigna Healthcare have reached a one-year contract after a previous contract expired on June 30, 2023. The new contract will allow Cigna customers in western Pennsylvania to continue to have in-network access to AHN facilities and doctors. The two organizations are also working on a longer, multi-year agreement.

The one-year contract is a stopgap measure that will give both sides time to negotiate a more permanent deal. AHN and Cigna have been at odds over reimbursement rates, with AHN arguing that it is not being paid enough by Cigna for the care it provides.

The one-year contract is a relief for Cigna customers who were facing the possibility of being out of network with AHN. Out-of-network care can be much more expensive than in-network care.

The two organizations are expected to finalize a longer, multi-year agreement in the next two weeks. The new agreement is likely to address the issue of reimbursement rates.
